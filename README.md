**Take full control of your automatic crafting!**

Better Crafter is a small but powerful mod that improves the usability of the Crafter block by making its behavior more predictable and automation-friendly.

This project is a **fork of the original [BetterCrafter](https://github.com/Fern-Aerell/BetterCrafter)** mod, which has been inactive and unmaintained for over 7 months and has not been updated for the latest Minecraft versions.

## Features  

### Reserved Crafting Slots   

- The Crafter will **not consume the last item** in each slot—these are treated as "reserved."
- You can place a **single instance of each item** in the desired slots to define a crafting pattern.
- Hoppers will automatically **stack matching items** into those reserved positions.

### Consistent Automation  

- Prevents random item placement when using hoppers.
- Makes automated crafting machines much more reliable.

### Simple and Vanilla-Friendly  

- No new blocks, GUIs, or configs.
- Works out-of-the-box with vanilla redstone and hoppers.

---

## Important  

To ensure the mod functions correctly, **all unused slots must be disabled** using the Crafter's interface. If free slots remain open, inserted items may still be placed randomly.

---

## Requirements  

- Fabric Loader  
- Fabric API ([Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) / [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api))

---

## Installation  

1. Install Fabric Loader and Fabric API.  
2. Drop the mod `.jar` into your `mods` folder.  
3. Launch the game and enjoy smarter crafting!
